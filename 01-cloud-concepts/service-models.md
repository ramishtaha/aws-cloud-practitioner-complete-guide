# 🔧 Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

> **The Three Pillars of Cloud Computing | Study Time: ~3 hours**

Imagine cloud computing as a **pizza delivery service**. You can:
- **Make everything yourself** (Traditional IT)
- **Get the ingredients delivered** and cook it yourself (IaaS)
- **Get a pre-made pizza** and just heat it up (PaaS)
- **Order a fully cooked pizza** delivered hot (SaaS)

Each model gives you different levels of control and responsibility!
