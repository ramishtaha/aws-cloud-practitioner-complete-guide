## 🌍 The 6 Rs of Migration

### 🏠 **Real-World Analogy: Moving Your Home**
Just like moving houses, there are different strategies for moving applications to the cloud:

```
Moving Strategies:
├── 📦 Take everything as-is (Rehost)
├── 🔧 Fix a few things while moving (Replatform)
├── 🏗️ Renovate completely (Refactor)
├── 🛒 Buy new instead (Repurchase)
├── 🗑️ Throw away what you don't need (Retire)
└── 🏠 Keep some things at the old house (Retain)
```

---

### 1️⃣ **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**

#### 🚚 **What is Rehosting?**
**Moving applications to the cloud with minimal or no changes** - like picking up your application and dropping it into AWS.

#### 🎯 **Key Characteristics:**
- **Minimal changes** - Application runs as-is
- **Fast migration** - Quickest way to get to cloud
- **Lower initial effort** - No code modifications needed
- **Infrastructure focus** - Move from physical to virtual

#### 🏆 **Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Speed** - Fastest migration approach
- 💰 **Immediate cost savings** - Reduce data center costs
- 🛡️ **Risk reduction** - Minimal changes = fewer problems
- 📈 **Quick wins** - Start benefiting from cloud immediately

#### 📊 **Rehost Example:**
```
Traditional Setup:
├── Physical servers running web application
├── Oracle database on dedicated hardware
├── Load balancer appliance
└── Network storage arrays

AWS Rehost:
├── EC2 instances (same OS, same application)
├── RDS for Oracle (managed database)
├── Application Load Balancer
└── EBS storage

Changes Made: Minimal - just infrastructure
Benefits: Immediate cloud economics
```

#### 🎯 **Best For:**
- **Legacy applications** with tight timelines
- **Proof of concept** migrations
- **Cost-driven** migration initiatives
- **Applications nearing end-of-life**

---

### 2️⃣ **Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**

#### 🔧 **What is Replatforming?**
**Making a few cloud optimizations** without changing the core architecture - like upgrading your appliances when you move houses.

#### 🎯 **Key Characteristics:**
- **Moderate changes** - Some optimization for cloud
- **Managed services** - Replace infrastructure with AWS services
- **Better performance** - Take advantage of cloud features
- **Reduced operational overhead** - Less management required

#### 🏆 **Benefits:**
- 📈 **Improved performance** - Cloud optimizations
- 💰 **Cost optimization** - Managed services are often cheaper
- 🛡️ **Reduced maintenance** - AWS handles infrastructure
- 🚀 **Foundation for future** - Sets stage for more modernization

#### 📊 **Replatform Example:**
```
Before (On-premises):
├── Application servers (self-managed)
├── Self-managed MySQL database
├── File storage on network drives
└── Custom load balancer setup

After (AWS Replatform):
├── EC2 instances (same application code)
├── Amazon RDS for MySQL (managed database)
├── Amazon EFS for file storage
└── Application Load Balancer

Changes Made: 
- Database → Managed RDS
- File storage → EFS
- Load balancer → ALB
Core application: Unchanged
```

#### 🎯 **Best For:**
- **Applications that can benefit** from managed services
- **Database modernization** candidates
- **Medium complexity** applications
- **Organizations wanting some optimization**

- **Modern technologies** - Microservices, serverless, containers
- **Maximum cloud benefits** - Full utilization of cloud capabilities

#### 🏆 **Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Maximum agility** - True cloud-native benefits
- 📈 **Best performance** - Optimized for cloud
- 💰 **Long-term cost efficiency** - Pay only for what you use
- 🔄 **Easier to maintain** - Modern, well-architected applications

#### 📊 **Refactor Example:**
```
Before (Monolithic):
├── Single large application
├── Tightly coupled components
├── Traditional database
└── Fixed infrastructure

After (Cloud-native):
├── Microservices architecture
│   ├── User service → Lambda + API Gateway
│   ├── Product service → ECS containers
│   ├── Order service → Lambda + SQS
│   └── Payment service → Lambda + DynamoDB
├── Event-driven communication

Benefits: Maximum cloud advantages
```

#### 🎯 **Best For:**
- **Strategic applications** with long-term value
- **High-traffic applications** needing scale
- **Developer productivity** focused initiatives
- **Greenfield projects** or major updates

---

### 4️⃣ **Repurchase (Replace)**

#### 🛒 **What is Repurchasing?**
**Moving to a different product** - like selling your old car and buying a new one instead of moving it.

#### 🎯 **Key Characteristics:**
- **New software solution** - Usually SaaS applications
- **Replace legacy systems** - Modern alternatives
- **Vendor managed** - Software as a Service
- **Different feature set** - May require process changes

#### 🏆 **Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Modern features** - Latest technology and capabilities
- 💰 **Predictable costs** - Subscription-based pricing
- 🛡️ **Reduced maintenance** - Vendor handles updates
- 📈 **Better user experience** - Modern interfaces and workflows

#### 📊 **Repurchase Examples:**
```

#### 🎯 **Key Characteristics:**
- **Application elimination** - Complete shutdown
- **No cloud migration** - Just turn off
- **Cost savings** - No ongoing expenses
- **Simplified IT** - Fewer systems to manage

#### 🏆 **Benefits:**
- 💰 **Immediate cost savings** - No migration or operating costs
- 🎯 **Simplified portfolio** - Focus on important applications
- 🛡️ **Reduced security risk** - Fewer systems to secure
- ⚡ **Faster overall migration** - Fewer applications to move

#### 📊 **Retirement Candidates:**
