### 6. 🌱 Sustainability Pillar

#### **Definition**
The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload.

#### **🎯 Design Principles**
- **Understand your impact** - Measure carbon footprint
- **Establish sustainability goals** - Set long-term targets
- **Maximize utilization** - Right-size resources
- **Anticipate and adopt new hardware** - Support efficient technologies
- **Use managed services** - Shared services reduce individual impact
- **Reduce downstream impact** - Minimize user device resource requirements
