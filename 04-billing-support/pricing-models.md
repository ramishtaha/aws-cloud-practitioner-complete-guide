├── Wednesday: $0.45/hour (high demand)
└── Thursday: $0.08/hour (low demand again)

Your Bid: $0.20/hour
├── Monday-Tuesday: Instance runs (price below bid)
├── Wednesday: Instance terminated (price above bid)
└── Thursday: Instance available again
```

#### **⚡ Spot Instance Lifecycle**
1. **Request Spot Instance** - Set maximum price you'll pay
2. **Instance launches** - When spot price ≤ your bid
3. **Instance runs normally** - Full EC2 functionality
4. **Price increases** - Above your maximum bid
5. **2-minute warning** - Spot instance interruption notice
6. **Instance terminates** - Automatically stopped or terminated

### 🎯 **Perfect Use Cases for Spot Instances**

#### **✅ Ideal Workloads**
- **Batch processing** - Jobs that can restart
- **Data analysis** - MapReduce, analytics jobs
- **Image/video processing** - Rendering, transcoding
- **Web crawling** - Fault-tolerant by nature
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Build and test environments
- **Machine learning training** - Can checkpoint and resume

#### **❌ Avoid Spot Instances For**
- **Production web servers** - Need guaranteed availability
- **Databases** - Risk of data loss on termination
- **Real-time applications** - Can't tolerate interruptions
- **Jobs without checkpointing** - Can't resume from where they left off

### 🛠️ **Spot Instance Strategies**

#### **🔄 Spot Fleet**
**Mix of instance types for better availability:**
```
Spot Fleet Configuration:
├── Instance Types: m5.large, m5.xlarge, c5.large, c5.xlarge

├── Allocation Strategy: Diversified
└── Target Capacity: 10 instances

Benefits:
├── Higher availability (multiple instance types)
├── Better pricing (can choose cheapest available)
└── Automatic replacement (if instances terminated)
```

#### **💾 Checkpointing Strategy**
**Save progress regularly:**
```
Batch Job Design:
├── Process data in chunks
├── Save progress every 30 minutes
├── Store checkpoint in S3
├── Resume from last checkpoint if interrupted
└── Final results saved to persistent storage
```

### 📊 **Spot Instance Savings Examples**

#### **🔬 Data Processing**
```
Workload: 100 hours of data processing per month
Instance: c5.2xlarge

On-Demand Cost:
├── $0.34/hour × 100 hours = $34/month

Spot Cost (average 70% discount):
├── $0.10/hour × 100 hours = $10/month
└── Savings: $24/month (70% savings)

Annual Savings: $288 (significant for ongoing workloads)
```

#### **🎥 Video Processing**
```
Workload: Nightly video transcoding
Duration: 4 hours/night × 30 days = 120 hours/month
Instance: m5.4xlarge

Comparison:
├── On-Demand: $0.768/hour × 120 = $92.16/month
├── Spot Average: $0.20/hour × 120 = $24/month
└── Savings: $68.16/month (74% savings)

Risk Mitigation:
├── Job designed to resume from interruption
├── Multiple instance types in Spot Fleet
└── Fallback to On-Demand if needed
```
