## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Content Mistakes

1. **Confusing Service Purposes**
   - Don't mix up RDS (relational) vs DynamoDB (NoSQL)
   - Don't confuse S3 (object) vs EBS (block) storage

2. **Misunderstanding Shared Responsibility**
   - AWS manages infrastructure, you manage your data and applications
   - Security "of" the cloud vs "in" the cloud

3. **Pricing Model Confusion**
   - On-Demand ≠ Reserved Instances
   - Spot Instances can be terminated by AWS

4. **Support Plan Features**
   - Basic is free but very limited
   - Business includes 24/7 support, Enterprise includes TAM

### ❌ Exam Strategy Mistakes

1. **Overthinking Simple Questions**
   - First instinct is often correct
   - Don't second-guess yourself excessively

2. **Spending Too Much Time on Hard Questions**
   - Flag difficult questions and return later
   - Ensure you answer all easy questions first

3. **Not Reading All Options**
   - Read all choices before selecting
   - Sometimes the "best" answer is the last one

4. **Ignoring Keywords**
   - "MOST cost-effective" usually means cheapest
   - "BEST practice" follows AWS recommendations
   - "LEAST operational overhead" often means managed services

### ❌ Technical Setup Mistakes (Online Exam)

1. **Poor Internet Connection**
   - Test your connection beforehand
   - Have a backup internet option

2. **Cluttered Workspace**
   - Remove all prohibited items
   - Only allowed: water in clear container
