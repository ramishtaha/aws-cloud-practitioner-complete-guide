## üå©Ô∏è Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### **Auto Scaling**
The automatic adjustment of computing resources based on demand. AWS Auto Scaling monitors applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

### **Broad Network Access**
One of the five essential characteristics of cloud computing. Cloud capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous client platforms.

### **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**
Money spent on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as buildings and equipment. Traditional IT infrastructure requires significant upfront CapEx for servers, data centers, and networking equipment.

### **Cloud Computing**
The on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It eliminates the need to invest in and maintain physical infrastructure.

### **Elasticity**
The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.

### **High Availability**
A system design approach and associated service implementation that ensures a prearranged level of operational uptime. AWS provides high availability through multiple data centers and fault tolerance.

### **Hybrid Cloud**
A cloud deployment model that combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services, allowing data and applications to be shared between them for greater flexibility and optimization.

### **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
A cloud computing model where a provider offers computer infrastructure (servers, storage, networks) as a service. AWS EC2 is an example of IaaS.

### **Measured Service**
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported.

### **On-Demand Self-Service**
The ability for users to provision computing capabilities automatically without requiring human interaction with service providers.

### **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**
An ongoing expense for running a business. Cloud computing typically converts IT costs from CapEx to OpEx through pay-as-you-go pricing.

### **Pay-as-you-go**
A pricing model where you only pay for the resources you actually use, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments unless you choose them.

### **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
A cloud computing model that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the infrastructure. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an example.

### **Private Cloud**
Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party and hosted internally or externally.

### **Public Cloud**
Cloud services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. AWS is a public cloud provider.

### **Resource Pooling**
The cloud provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.

### **Scalability**
The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources to the system. Can be vertical (scaling up) or horizontal (scaling out).

### **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
A cloud computing model where applications are hosted by a service provider and made available to customers over the internet. Examples include Office 365 and Salesforce.
